# The DevOps Guide

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is all about getting your solutions to run efficiently from deployment to updates.
It's not specific to Cloud, as you can implement DevOps practices on-prem as well.

DevOps is a culture, where development and operations teams are no longer isolated. These two groups are converged into a single group where the engineers work across the whole application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and foster a scope of abilities not restricted to a single function.

Read up on what DevOps is:

- [AWS - What is DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)
- [IBM - A DevOps complete guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide)
- [Microsoft - What is DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-devops/#overview)

I also think it's worth reading [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/) it's a pretty fun read because it's a fictional story but it explains the importance of DevOps. But if you'd prefer something more like a textbook with similar ideas, check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/the-devops-handbook/).

## Some DevOps Fundamentals:

- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- Version Control System (VCS)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Configuration management
- Monitoring (logs, metrics, traces)
