# CI-CD: Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment

## What is CI-CD?

It is a development methodology, known as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD), addresses common issues that arise throughout the integration process. It gets more challenging to maintain a working main branch that is free of defects and mistakes as more developers work in parallel. The integration process is automated with CI/CD, and the app's lifecycle is continuously observed. The goal of this practise is to prevent "integration hell," which occurs when several developers who have been working on different features independently find it difficult to integrate all of their code without significant conflicts and must take the time to examine all of their code to correct it.

Here is what "integration hell" means according to [Innovation Roots](https://innoroo.com/blog/2018/03/19/integration-hell-glossary/)
> Integration Hell is one of the biggest challenges in traditional software development environments. The Integration process is very rarely smooth and seamless, and results in hours of re-fixing the code, sometimes leading up to days, before it can finally integrate. One of the biggest challenges being the dependency relationship between the code thatâ€™s built, and the rest of the code in the system.

> Continuous Integration is the process defined to completely avoid this process, by creating an infrastructure where the built-in code can be integrated immediately into the project. It overall goes to great lengths to encourage team members to integrate regularly.
